# Machine Learning Basics

## Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

**Applications:**
- Email spam detection
- Image classification
- Medical diagnosis
- Price prediction

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. It discovers structures and relationships in data.

**Common Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- DBSCAN

**Applications:**
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Data compression
- Market basket analysis

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

**Key Concepts:**
- Agent: The learner or decision maker
- Environment: The world the agent interacts with
- Action: What the agent can do
- Reward: Feedback from the environment

**Applications:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go)
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Trading algorithms

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning

- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Fix inconsistent data formats
- Deal with outliers

### Feature Engineering

- Feature selection
- Feature transformation
- Feature scaling (normalization, standardization)
- Creating new features from existing ones

### Data Splitting

- Training set (60-80%)
- Validation set (10-20%)
- Test set (10-20%)

## Model Evaluation

### Metrics for Classification

- **Accuracy**: Correct predictions / Total predictions
- **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the ROC curve

### Metrics for Regression

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

### Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is a technique to assess model performance by training and testing on different subsets of data.

**Types:**
- K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Stratified K-Fold
- Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation

## Common Challenges

### Overfitting

When a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new data.

**Solutions:**
- Regularization (L1, L2)
- Cross-validation
- More training data
- Feature selection
- Early stopping

### Underfitting

When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

**Solutions:**
- Increase model complexity
- Add more features
- Reduce regularization
- Train for more epochs

### Data Quality Issues

- Insufficient data
- Biased data
- Noisy data
- Missing values

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with simple models before moving to complex ones
2. **Understand Your Data**: Perform exploratory data analysis
3. **Feature Engineering**: Good features often matter more than algorithms
4. **Validate Properly**: Use appropriate validation techniques
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track model performance over time
6. **Document Everything**: Keep track of experiments and results
7. **Consider Ethics**: Be aware of bias and fairness in your models
