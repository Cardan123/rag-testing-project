# Deep Learning Guide

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. It's inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

## Neural Network Fundamentals

### Basic Components

**Neurons (Nodes)**: Basic processing units that receive inputs, apply a transformation, and produce an output.

**Layers**: Collections of neurons that process data at the same level of abstraction.

**Weights and Biases**: Parameters that the network learns during training to make accurate predictions.

**Activation Functions**: Mathematical functions that determine whether a neuron should be activated.

### Common Activation Functions

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: f(x) = max(0, x)
- **Sigmoid**: f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
- **Tanh**: f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))
- **Softmax**: Used in the output layer for multi-class classification

## Types of Neural Networks

### Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)

The simplest type where information flows in one direction from input to output.

**Use Cases:**
- Basic classification
- Regression problems
- Simple pattern recognition

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images.

**Key Components:**
- Convolutional layers
- Pooling layers
- Fully connected layers

**Applications:**
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Medical image analysis
- Computer vision

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Designed for sequential data with connections that create loops.

**Variants:**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Handles long-term dependencies
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: Simplified version of LSTM

**Applications:**
- Natural language processing
- Time series forecasting
- Speech recognition
- Machine translation

### Transformer Networks

Modern architecture that relies on attention mechanisms.

**Key Features:**
- Self-attention mechanism

## Training Deep Networks

### Forward Propagation

Data flows from input layer through hidden layers to output layer, making predictions.

### Backpropagation

Algorithm that calculates gradients and updates weights to minimize the loss function.

### Loss Functions

**For Classification:**
- Cross-entropy loss
- Categorical cross-entropy
- Binary cross-entropy

**For Regression:**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Huber loss

### Optimization Algorithms

- **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**
- **Adam**: Adaptive moment estimation
- **RMSprop**: Root Mean Square propagation
- **AdaGrad**: Adaptive gradient algorithm

## Regularization Techniques

### Dropout

Randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training to prevent overfitting.

### Batch Normalization

Normalizes inputs to each layer to stabilize training and improve convergence.

### L1 and L2 Regularization

Add penalty terms to the loss function to prevent overfitting.

### Early Stopping

Stop training when validation performance stops improving.

## Deep Learning Frameworks
